2. ðŸ’¯ setup function
Add tests titled:

allows customization of the initial count
allows customization of the step
And test those use cases. Then abstract away the common logic into a setup function. This one might be a little tricky thanks to variable references, but I know you can do it!

ðŸ’° Here's a little tip. Due to variable references, you'll need to change your test component a bit:

const results = {}
function TestComponent(props) {
  Object.assign(results, useCustomHook())
  return null
}

// interact with and assert on results here

/*
I'd already written these tests as an extension of the basic exercise, so it was a bit of copypasta
and then some adopting to what I'd done in Extra Credit 1, moving away from the new component.

Honestly, this one kind of confuses me. The initial local scoping approach doesn't get strung up by
variable references, and seems to work just fine. Sometimes copypasta just solves problems, and
trying to apply DRY isn't always great. We'll see what KCD has to say.

Eh, I'm not super-impressed. But defaulting to the Senior Engineer thing, specifically that my job
as a junior engineer is to accept and to understand the senior's wisdom.
